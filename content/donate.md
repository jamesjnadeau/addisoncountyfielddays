# Capitla Campaign

As we embark on our 77th year of celebrating the cherished traditions and vibrant community spirit that define our rural heritage, we're thrilled to announce the launch of our 2025 Capital Campaign. 

Over the past three-quarters of a century, we've grown to become Vermont's largest agricultural fair, a testament to the dedication and passion of our community. In a world that's constantly evolving, our goal is to remain that one annual event where the essence of tradition endures, a touchstone of our shared roots. However, with the realities of rising costs and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, it's imperative that we adapt and prepare for a sustainable future. This campaign aims to address several vital areas, including the construction of a permanent building to replace our existing show tent, creating a potential year-round venue for community gatherings. 

We also envision building an antique house to showcase our rich historical collections and honor the agricultural legacy that forms the very foundation of our fair. Furthermore, addressing stormwater runoff and expanding parking and improving roads are crucial for ensuring accessibility and a comfortable experience for all our visitors. These are just a few of the essential projects we aim to undertake with the funds raised. 

We invite you to join us in preserving this treasured event for generations to come. As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, all donations are tax-deductible, making your contribution a meaningful investment in the future of our community and its heritage.
