### Entry Tags
NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE N0. REQUIRED and if appropriate, grade of syrup or recipe must be included with each entry. All entries become the property of ACMSA.

Use only new, unused containers for all maple products. Always use only hot water to clean maple equipment and containers. Do not use dish soap or other kinds of soap when cleaning and preparing maple equipment or containers as soap will flavor the syrup or contents of the container. No containers or dishes will be returned to the exhibitor. Ribbons and any prize money will be available after 6 p.m. on Saturday night.

### Classes
1. Maple Syrup: USING NEW GRADING SYSTEM, 1 full pint of:
    a. Golden Color/ Delicate Flavor 
    b. Amber Color/ Rich Taste
    c. Dark Color/Robust Taste 
    d. Very Dark Color/Strong Taste
    e. Backyard/Beginner
    Please label appropriately. Judging will be based on color, clarity, density and favor. Be sure container meets the size requirements - one full pint.
2. Maple Candy (sugar cakes): 8 oz. 
Make sure you use good-flavored syrup. Check the boiling point of water when you make any maple product and adjust the temperature to avoid making product that is too soft or too hard. Submit 4-8 pieces for judging.
3. Maple Cream: 1/2 lb.
Use light colored and good favored syrup. Watch temperature and adjust accordingly. Maple cream picks up other favors quickly. Pack cream in new 8-oz. jars or other airtight containers.
4. Indian Sugar: 8 oz.
Try to get consistent sized grains in the product. (You might want to put through a sieve.) Avoid large crystals.
5. Maple Specialty: All entries must have an accompanying recipe. All recipes must contain at least 1/2 cup of maple syrup.
