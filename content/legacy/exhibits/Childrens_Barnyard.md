## EDUCATIONAL DISPLAYS

The Children’s Barnyard will have a competition for educational displays again this year.
This is a great opportunity for both kids and adults to show off and educate the public about
their animals, there are a couple of options of how to do this. Displays may be attended or
unattended. The purpose for attended displays is to allow the exhibitors to share with the public
their experiences with their animal and to answer any questions about their exhibit. Exhibitors
must stay with their animal in the Children’s Barnyard area during their attended times..

Exhibits will be judged on the following criteria:

1. Clean & neat appearance of handler & overall health of animal
2. Educational content/informational posters
3. Interaction with the public
4. Knowledge of animal
5. Interest in animal & exhibit
