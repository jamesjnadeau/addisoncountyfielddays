We are very excited to be in our 21st year as a North American Classic Six qualifying show.
-->

All draft horses and draft ponies are welcome. We will have Haflinger Classes again this
year.

a.m. on Saturday. 
Six ribbons will be awarded in each class. 
Stalls will be available after 7 p.m. Thursday. 

Stalls are limited (156) so we cannot offer tack stalls. Stalls will be reserved based on date entries received by the Secretary. A $25.00 per stall deposit is required. $15.00 will be refunded per stall when cleaned and checked. Please call if unable to attend as we do have a limited number of stalls. If stalls fill we will keep a waiting list. Sawdust may or may not be available (depending if it is all gone). Shavings will be available to purchase ahead of time at $6.00 per bag; they will be in the horse area to be picked up by the exhibitor.

Entry Fees are $5.00 per class except as noted. Post entries are double entry fees. No refunds
without a vet certificate. Pre-entries due by August 1, {year}.

   enthusiast and teamster for Donnell Belgians since 2006. Matt was a friend to all and proudly showed at
   Addison County Fair and Field Days for 16 years.
8. ### OUTSTANDING BELGIAN/PERCHERON/CLYDE/SHIRE & FARM YOUTH

   Awarded to the high point youth in each age group.

### Dear Draft Horse Exhibitors,

‚Ä¢ We are pleased to share some changes for our {year} draft show and hope our dates of
Friday, August {friday}‚Äì Saturday, August {saturday} will allow us to fill all stalls. We have a total of
156 stalls available.

‚Ä¢ We will welcome as our {year} judge: Malcolm Yeadon, Ontario, CA

‚Ä¢ We will again be a North American Classic Six qualifying show. We offer classes for the
Six Horse Hitch, Classic Cart and Youth Cart.

‚Ä¢ We require a stall deposit of $ 25.00 per stall with $ 15.00 returned if it is cleaned when
you leave. It sometimes takes 30 to 40 minutes with a bucket tractor to clean each stall
and finding folks to clean them for the refund is next to impossible and we have between
20 to 40 stalls that we clean.

**VERY IMPORTANT** - camping forms need to be in by the deadline of August 1. (Not mailed on August 1 but in our hands by August 1) 
This is to help us make sure there is enough room on the camping bars. It is
sometimes a very tight squeeze with last minute camping space needed. 
Length of camper is important as not all sites are the same length. Again, we will keep a waiting list if spaces fill up.

The fair provides the 4-H kids with sawdust for their shows, the draft horse exhibitors are welcome to use any remaining sawdust. 
Sometimes we run out of the sawdust and have bagged shavings available for a fee. 
So if you want to purchase bagged shavings ahead of time, they are $6.00 per bag and the fair would deliver pre-orders to the horse area (not to the stalls) before the show, to be picked up by the exhibitor on Thursday evening before 10:00 P.M. 
Additional shavings are located at the dairy barns, so on Friday and Saturday you would have to get them yourself if not ordered ahead of time.

We look forward to seeing you in August at our draft show. We encourage
early entries because we are limited on stalls and camping spots.

Please, please, when filling out the entry form complete all information. If
a halter horse or single horse hitch class they go in the top part, if a team hitch
class, they go in the bottom part with the names of each driver for the class
if different. Look for the class numbers as to what is needed for information.

When making your travel plans, we recommend that you do
not use Route 125 between Route 100 in Hancock and Route 7 in
East Middlebury to travel to the show. This section of Route 125 is

 not recommended for trailer trucks.‚Äù
