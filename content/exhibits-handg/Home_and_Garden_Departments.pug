    | THIS ART EXHIBITION IS FOR AMATEURS. (A professional artist is one who creates

    | from their art work.)
  ol
    li    Age groups for entries are: Youth 4-12, Teen 13-18,  Adult 19 and older.
    li
      | The superintendent will refuse work that is deemed to be craftwork, i.e. paint by number and predesigned kits. All work must be the artist&rsquo;s original and rendered by hand. No air brushed, computer generated or mechanically enhanced works will be accepted.  No work that is graphic design or lettering will be accepted.
    li
      | Work entered must have been completed since the date of the last fair, August {prev_year}, and should not have been previously exhibited.
    li
      | Size restrictions. The maximum size for each piece, including the frame, is 20&rdquo;x30&rdquo; or a total frame perimeter of 100&rdquo;.
    li
      | Entries must consist of a single image. No multiple images or sets are allowed.
    li
      | Framing instructions.  All work must be suitably framed. However, unframed, &ldquo;gallery wrapped&rdquo; canvases, with a depth of 1&half;&rdquo; or greater and with the edges painted are acceptable. Glass and plexiglass are acceptable and encouraged, but not required. Judges take matting and framing into account when evaluating all work.
    li
      | Hanging instructions. Hanging cable must be installed on the backs of the paintings. Screw eyes should be used on the back of the work to hold the wire and be placed about &frac13; of the way down from the top of the frame on each side.  The wire should be attached so that when the piece is hung it does not show above the frame. Note: There will be no material at the Home and Garden Building for entrants to use to rig work for hanging. Again, framing and hanging must be complete before arriving with an entry.
    li    Sawtooth and clip hangers are not permitted.

Folk Art exists in any medium and is often made of found or repurposed materials. Folk Artists often use or construct materials in new and nontraditional ways. Although some pieces are designed as art and evoke a feeling for the surroundings and/or culture, many pieces also serve a utilitarian function.

    | Entrants in the Folk-Art category may include a paragraph about their work. The paragraph may include what inspired the piece, their choice of materials and/or what they hope to convey.
