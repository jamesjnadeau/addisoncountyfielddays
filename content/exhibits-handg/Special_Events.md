The Antique area at Addison County Fair and Field Days is one ofthe finest in New England.
Displays are housed in a local barn that was dismantled and reassembled on the grounds in 1993. 
The Antique area has many motion exhibits which consist ofthrashing grain, baling
straw, milling corn, sawing shingles on a circular saw mill, cutting firewood with a drag saw
powered both by horse and a single cylinder engine. 

Also, many outdoor exhibits that are powered by horses. Those include reaping and binding, sickle bar mowing, tedding hay, raking hay and using a hay loader. 
This year the Green Mountain Teamsters will be there to help with the Antique Equipment Area demonstrations. 
There is also an overflowing tent of local antique tractors. Many ofwhich were and still are used on local farms.
