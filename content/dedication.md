Title: 2024 Dedication
Description: We are dedicating this year’s fair to you

# Dedication

This year we are pleased to dedicate our fair to sunshine and warm weather! After a year of mud and rain, we are enlisting the help of Mother Nature to give us warm days, sunshine, and cool breezes!

We thank all the 2023 fair personnel, exhibitors, vendors, volunteers, and fair goers for your support during last year’s rainy event.

This year promises to bring all the usual vendors, rides, fair food, exhibits, kids, and animals and all their glory!

Although paving the parking lot was not in the cards or the state’s groundwater rules, we have a beautiful new livestock barn to house the beef and open dairy cattle. We hope you will enjoy our green grass and improvements to a few really soft areas of the grounds and roads.

See you at Addison County Field Days, August 6 through 10, 2024!
