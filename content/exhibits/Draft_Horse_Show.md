We are very excited to be in our 21st year as a North American Classic Six qualifying show.
-->

All draft horses and draft ponies are welcome. We will have Haflinger Classes again this
year. 

Classes will proceed in numerical order beginning at 9:30 a.m. on Friday and 9:30
a.m. on Saturday. 
Six ribbons will be awarded in each class. 
Stalls will be available after 7 p.m. Thursday. 

Stalls are limited (156) so we cannot offer tack stalls. Stalls will be reserved based on date entries received by the Secretary. A $25.00 per stall deposit is required. $15.00 will be refunded per stall when cleaned and checked. Please call if unable to attend as we do have a limited number of stalls. If stalls fill we will keep a waiting list. Sawdust may or may not be available (depending if it is all gone). Shavings will be available to purchase ahead of time at $6.00 per bag; they will be in the horse area to be picked up by the exhibitor.

Entry Fees are $5.00 per class except as noted. Post entries are double entry fees. No refunds
without a vet certificate. Pre-entries due by August 1, {year}.

   Awarded to the high point youth in each age group.

### Dear Draft Horse Exhibitors,

• We are pleased to share some changes for our {year} draft show and hope our dates of
Friday, August {friday}– Saturday, August {saturday} will allow us to fill all stalls. We have a total of
156 stalls available.

• We will welcome as our {year} judge: Malcolm Yeadon, Ontario, CA

• We will again be a North American Classic Six qualifying show. We offer classes for the
Six Horse Hitch, Classic Cart and Youth Cart.

• We require a stall deposit of $ 25.00 per stall with $ 15.00 returned if it is cleaned when
you leave. It sometimes takes 30 to 40 minutes with a bucket tractor to clean each stall
and finding folks to clean them for the refund is next to impossible and we have between
20 to 40 stalls that we clean.
